# ChimeHelper - Easy access to Amazon Chime meetings

**Note:** This project is not an official Amazon project

ChimeHelper gives you direct access to your Chime meetings in your Windows tray so that:

1. You no longer need to open your Outlook calendar to find meetings that weren't configured to auto-dial (so they don't show in the Chime UX)
2. You not longer have to have auto-dial enabled, especially useful when you are invited to a lot of different, overlapping, meetings
3. If you only use Chime for meetings you don't have to have it open when you're not on a meeting

## Features

1. Displays all recent and upcoming Outlook meetings that contain Chime PINs with single click meeting launch
2. Optional auto-dial that triggers on the hour (instead of Chime's minute before)
3. Shortcuts to:
   1. copy your meeting details
   2. create an ad-hoc meeting
   3. join a meeting by ID (including parsing Chime IDs from the clipboard)

## Requirements

1. Outlook
2. Amazon Chime
